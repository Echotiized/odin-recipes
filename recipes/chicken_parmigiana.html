        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This Chicken Parmigiana features thick-cut, butterflied chicken breasts that are marinated for flavor and coated in crispy panko breadcrumbs before being shallow-fried to a golden brown.</p>
            <p>The resulting crunchy chicken is then topped with a rich tomato sauce and a melty combination of Parmesan and low-moisture mozzarella cheese, then broiled until bubbly and browned.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>4 <strong>Skinless, boneless chicken breasts</strong></li>
                <li>4 cups of <strong>Panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)</strong></li>
                <li>2 cups of <strong>All-purpose flour</strong></li>
                <li>4 <strong>Large eggs</strong></li>
                <li>2 28 oz cans of <strong>Tomato purée</strong> <em>(Rao's brand is preferred)</em></li>
                <li>2 tsbp of <strong>Double-concentrated tomato paste</strong></li>
                <li>12 oz <strong>Low moisture mozzarella</strong></li>
                <li>8 oz of <strong>Pre-grated Parmesan</strong></li>
                <li>3/4 cup of <strong>Extra-virgin olive oil</strong> for garnish</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prepare the tomato sauce:</strong> Heat olive oil, then cook onion and garlic until softened. Add tomato paste and red pepper flakes and cook until the paste darkens. Stir in tomato purée, salt, and sugar, then simmer partially covered until slightly thickened, about 40-50 minutes. The sauce can be made ahead of time.</li>
                <li><strong>Butterfly and pound the chicken breasts:</strong> Slice each chicken breast horizontally, almost all the way through, and open it like a book. Place the butterflied breast between wax paper or plastic wrap and pound until it's about ⅓" thick.</li>
                <li><strong>Marinate the chicken:</strong> Combine grated garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil in a baking dish. Season the chicken cutlets with salt and add them to the marinade, turning to coat. Let marinate for at least 20 minutes and up to 1 hour.</li>
                <li><strong>Set up a dredging station:</strong> Prepare three shallow bowls: one with flour mixed with salt, one with whisked eggs, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and water, and one with panko breadcrumbs.</li>
                <li><strong>Dredge the chicken cutlets:</strong> Working one at a time, dredge the marinated chicken in the seasoned flour, then dip it in the egg wash, letting excess drip off. Finally, dredge it in the panko breadcrumbs, pressing firmly to ensure they adhere completely. Place the breaded cutlets on a baking sheet and chill for at least 20 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare the cheese mixture:</strong> Grate the low-moisture mozzarella cheese and combine it with the pre-grated Parmesan cheese in a bowl.</li>
                <li><strong>Shallow-fry the chicken:</strong> Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet until it reaches 400°F. Working in batches to avoid overcrowding, carefully fry the breaded chicken cutlets until they are deep golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer the fried cutlets to a wire rack set inside a baking sheet and season them with salt.</li>
                <li><strong>Assemble and broil the Chicken Parmesan:</strong> Arrange the fried chicken cutlets in baking dishes. Generously spoon the prepared tomato sauce over each cutlet, leaving some edges uncovered. Spoon the remaining sauce around the cutlets and then cover them with the mozzarella-Parmesan cheese mixture, again leaving some crispy edges exposed.</li>
                <li><strong>Broil until bubbly and browned:</strong> Place the baking dish(es) under a preheated broiler and cook until the cheese is melted, bubbling, and browned in spots, about 4 minutes. Let the chicken cool slightly before garnishing with parsley and serving.</li>
