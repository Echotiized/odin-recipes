                <li>1 tsbp of <strong>Olive oil</strong></li>
                <li>1 lb of <strong>Ground italian sausage</strong></li>
                <li>4 cloves of <strong>Garlic</strong></li>
                <li>32 oz of <strong>Marinara sauce</strong> <em>(Rao's brand is preferred)</em></li>
                <li>1/2 tsbp of <strong>Red pepper flakes</strong></li>
                <li>3 cups of <strong>Shredded mozzarella cheese</strong></li>
                <li>1/2 cup of <strong>Pecorino Romano cheese</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Minced fresh parsley</strong> for garnish</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and butter a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the ziti pasta about a minute less than the package directions suggest for al dente. Then, drain the pasta and set it aside, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the ground Italian sausage and cook, breaking it up into crumbles, for about 5-6 minutes until it's cooked through. Drain any excess grease.</li>
                <li>Return the cooked sausage to the skillet and add the minced garlic. Stir well to combine.</li>
                <li>Pour in the marinara sauce and add the red pepper flakes. Stir everything together and then lower the heat to keep the sauce at a simmer for about 10 minutes, until heated through and slightly thickened.</li>
                <li>Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in the cooked pasta until it is well combined with the sauce.</li>
                <li>Transfer half of the ziti mixture into the prepared baking dish. Top this layer with half of the shredded mozzarella cheese and half of the Pecorino Romano cheese.</li>
                <li>Spread the remaining ziti mixture over the cheese layer in the baking dish. Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella and Pecorino Romano cheeses evenly over the top.</li>
                <li>Bake the ziti in the preheated oven, uncovered, for 20 minutes, or until it is hot and bubbly. Let it cool for 5-10 minutes before garnishing with minced fresh parsley and serving.</li>
