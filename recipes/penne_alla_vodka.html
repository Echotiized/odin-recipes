            <p>This Penne Alla Vodka is a classic and easy-to-make pasta dish featuring penne in a flavorful vodka-infused tomato sauce made with ingredients like prosciutto, tomato paste, cream, and seasonings.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 lb of <strong>Penne</strong></li>
                <li>28 oz of <strong>Crushed tomatoes</strong></li>
                <li>1 cup of <strong>Heavy cream</strong></li>
                <li>3/4 cup of <strong>Vodka</strong></li>
                <li>1/4 lb of <strong>Roughly chopped prosciutto</strong></li>
                <li>2 tsbp of <strong>Tomato paste</strong></li>
                <li>3 cloves of <strong>Minced garlic</strong></li>
                <li>1/2 cup of <strong>Grated parmesan cheese</strong></li>
                <li>1 tsbp of <strong>Olive oil</strong></li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Saut√© the prosciutto in olive oil in a skillet over medium heat until it begins to brown, which should take about 2-3 minutes. Then, set the prosciutto aside and roughly chop it once it has cooled.</li>
                <li>Turn the heat off and add the vodka to the same skillet. Then, set the heat to medium and use a silicone spatula to scrape the bottom and sides of the skillet. Let the vodka bubble gently and reduce by half, which will take about 4-5 minutes or until you can no longer smell the alcohol.</li>
                <li>Add the butter and minced garlic to the skillet and cook for 1-2 minutes. Then, add the tomato paste, chicken broth, chicken bouillon, honey, hot sauce, and the seasonings (basil, dried oregano, red pepper flakes). Stir to combine these ingredients.</li>
                <li>Add the cooked prosciutto back into the skillet. Then, add the crushed tomatoes. Bring the sauce to a boil, then reduce the heat to low to maintain a gentle simmer. Let it bubble gently and reduce, partially covered, while you begin to boil salted water for the pasta.</li>
                <li>Once the salted water is boiling, cook the penne for 1 minute less than the package directions suggest for al dente. Before draining the pasta, reserve about 1 cup of the pasta water. Then, drain the pasta.</li>
                <li>Reduce the heat under the sauce to low and stir in the heavy cream until it is fully combined.</li>
                <li>Add the cooked penne to the sauce and stir well to combine, ensuring all the pasta is coated.</li>
                <li>Add the reserved pasta water as needed to reach your desired consistency. The pasta water helps the sauce cling to the pasta and adds a smooth finish.</li>
                <li>Remove the skillet from the heat and, if desired, swirl in 1 tablespoon of cold butter just before serving. This optional step adds a smooth and sparkly finish to the sauce, a technique called "monte au beurre". Serve immediately with freshly grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
